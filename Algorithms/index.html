                <h1 id="title" style="font-size:50px;"><b><u>Algorithms</b></u></h1>
                <h2><b><u>Types of Algorithms:</u></b></h2>
                <p>Four commonly used sorting algorithms are Bubble sorts,<br> Bucket sorts, Shell sorts and Insertion sorts.</p>
                <h2><b><u>Bubble Sort Algorithm</u></b></h2>
                <p>A bubble sorting algorithm compares two numbers that are side <br> by side and checks if they are in or out of the order asked for, <br> for the final result. It will repeat this numerous times and will <br> finally come to the organised result. When the algorithm has <br> finished sorting all the numbers it is called a “pass”.</p>
                <p>A bubble sort algorithm will be used to make a simple easy <br> computer program that will tell the computer to check if <br> numbers are in order and swap them if needed.</p>
                <p>A bubble sort algorithm will not be used if there are lots of values for <br> the computer to bubble sort, because the computer will take a while to <br> process the task and check all the numbers, although it probably will be <br> quicker than a human brain.</p>
                <h2><b><u>Bucket Sort Algorithm</u></b></h2>
                <p>Two important pieces of information do you need before you can <br> start a bucket sort are the amount of values you have and which <br> they are and the bucket ranges you are going to use to sort the <br> values.</p>
                <p>A bucket sorting algorithm will sort values given to the computer into <br> categories (into buckets) that can be either a range of numbers (e.g. 4 <br> would go into the range 1-10) or a string category (e.g. there are two <br> buckets: “colours” and “names”. The colour “blue”, that would have <br> to be defined earlier and told that it would go into the “colours” <br> bucket, would go into the bucket called “colours” and not “names”) <br> and will then take them out of those categories and bubble sort them.</p>
                <p>The bucket sorting algorithm find the upper and lower bounds in the <br> list finding the bucket containing the number range with the highest <br> and lowest values.</p>
                <h2><b><u>Insertion Sorts:</u></b></h2>
                <p>An insertion sorting algorithm is very similar to the bubble sort but <br> will start with one value and then will compare the following values <br> that it adds on (e.g. a list of two numbers: 15, 12. Start with 15. <br> Then the next number in the list is 12. The computer will insert <br> this number before the 15 because it 12 less than 15).</p>
